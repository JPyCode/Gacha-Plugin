# GachaPlugin
### GachaPlugin is a Minecraft plugin that implements a simple and interactive "Gacha" system, allowing players to receive random rewards when they use a special command. With a custom graphical user interface (GUI), the plugin offers a fun way to reward players with different rarity items.

## Features
- /gacha Command: Players can open the Gacha interface and participate in the reward drawing by using the /gacha command.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The interface displays a "rolling" animation before revealing the final reward, which can be any item from the configured rewards.
- Random Rewards: The reward system is based on configured chances, with each item having a probability of being drawn.
- Visual Animation: During the Gacha roll, the items on the interface change randomly until the final reward is revealed.
- Diverse Rewards: I used several items when creating the plugin, but in the end the choice is completely yours. 

## How to Use
### 1. Installation:

- Download the .jar file and place it in the plugins folder of your Minecraft server.
- Restart the server or reload the plugins with /reload.
### 2. Command:

In-game, players can use the /gacha command to open the Gacha reward interface.
### 3. How it Works:

- When the command is executed, the graphical interface will open with an animation of random items spinning.
- After a few seconds, the drawing will finish, and the player will receive a random reward.
- The system has configurable chances for each item, with rarer rewards having a lower probability of appearing.
## Code Structure
### Main Class (GachaPlugin)
The main class of the plugin is responsible for registering events and commands. Upon initialization (onEnable), it sets up the pluginâ€™s event listeners and commands.

- Events: The GachaGUI is registered as an event listener, allowing the plugin to handle player interactions with the Gacha GUI.
- /gacha Command: The /gacha command is registered and mapped to the executor GachaCommand, allowing players to open the reward interface by typing the command in chat.

```java
public final class GachaPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        // Register events and GUI
        getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new GachaGUI(null), this);

        // Register the /gacha command
        getCommand("gacha").setExecutor(new GachaCommand(this));

        getLogger().info("@ Gacha Plugin enabled.");
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        getLogger().info("@ Gacha Plugin disabled.");
    }
}
````
### GachaGUI Class
The GachaGUI class handles the creation of the graphical interface, the drawing of rewards, and the animation of the items on the screen. When the player uses the /gacha command, this GUI opens and shows a random animation before a reward is revealed.

### GachaCommand Class
The GachaCommand class is responsible for managing the /gacha command, allowing players to open the reward interface and start the reward drawing process.

## Example Rewards
The GachaPlugin reward system is configured with items and their respective chances of being drawn. For example:

- Diamond Block (5% chance)
- Iron Block (10% chance)
- Coal Block (35% chance)
- Gold Block (20% chance)
- Lapis Lazuli Block (20% chance)
These values can be easily configured and adjusted in the code.

## Requirements
- Minecraft Server with support for Spigot or Paper.
- Java 17+ (or compatible version).
